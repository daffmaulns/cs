## FIRST SECTION THEY SEE

**Headline:**
Train your thinking.

**Subheadline:**
Archiv is an AI that refuses to do the work for you. It forces you to recall, reason, and understand — so when it matters, you fall back to training.

**Primary CTA:**
Start training

**Secondary CTA:**
See how it works

**Small reassurance line (under CTAs):**
Free to start. Built for people who still want to think.

## SECTION 1 – FOR WHO

**Eyebrow:**
For minds that won’t outsource thinking.

**Headline:**
Not an answer machine. A training rig.

**Body:**
Most AI gives you the solution.
Archiv does the opposite.

It slows you down.
Pushes back.
Asks what you see, what you remember, what you’d try next.

Because under stress — in an exam, an interview, a presentation —
you don’t rise to the occasion.
You fall back to training.

Archiv is where that training happens.

## SECTION 2 – HOW ARCHIV WORKS

**Eyebrow:**
What it does, in three moves.

**Headline:**
You think first. AI follows.

**Step 1 — You answer.**
You don’t paste the question and wait. Archiv asks you to try.
Write what you know. Sketch the steps. Guess if you have to.

**Step 2 — Archiv challenges you.**
It doesn’t dump a solution. It asks questions.
“Why this step?”
“What else could work?”
“What are you assuming?”

You get hints, pressure, and structure — not shortcuts.

**Step 3 — Training locks in.**
When you finally see the answer, it’s not new.
It’s familiar.
You’ve already wrestled with it.
Archiv brings it back later, under time and stress,
until your brain treats it as a reflex.

That’s the point:
when it counts, you don’t think from scratch.
You fall back to training.

## SECTION 3 – WHAT A SESSION FEELS LIKE

**Eyebrow:**
Inside a session.

**Headline:**
Closer to a coach than a chatbot.

**Example dialogue block (you can format as UI later):**

> **You:** I don’t get this limit. I think the answer is 0.
> **Archiv:** Before we decide, show me how you got there.
>
> **You:** The numerator goes to 0, denominator blows up, so 0?
> **Archiv:** Good start. What’s the exact form of the denominator? Can you write it?
>
> **You:** It’s √(x² + 1). As x → ∞, that ~ |x|.
> **Archiv:** Right. So what does the fraction look like for very large x?
>
> **You:** Like 1/x.
> **Archiv:** And what happens to 1/x as x → ∞?
>
> **You:** It goes to 0.
> **Archiv:** Now it’s your conclusion, not mine.

No instant answers.
No copy-paste.
Just you, under gentle pressure, getting sharper.

## SECTION 4 – WHY ARCHIV (DIFFERENTIATION)

**Eyebrow:**
If you just want shortcuts, this isn’t for you.

**Headline:**
Built for people who plan to be good under pressure.

**Body:**
Archiv is designed for exam days, whiteboards, and real-life stakes.

* When the timer is running.
* When your hands are shaking a little.
* When you don’t have notes, friends, or a second attempt.

Most tools help you finish tonight’s homework faster.
Archiv trains you to walk into the room ready.

This isn’t about getting through the course.
It’s about becoming the person who doesn’t panic when it matters.

## SECTION 5 – FOR STUDENTS & UNIVERSITIES

### Column 1 – For students

**Headline:**
For students who are tired of pretending.

**Body:**
If you’re done with memorizing slides you’ll forget tomorrow, Archiv gives you:

* Daily training sessions that feel like sparring, not scrolling.
* Questions that force you to retrieve, not just re-read.
* A record of what you actually understand — not what you’ve copied.

Use it for math, science, programming, theory-heavy courses, or anything that cracks under stress.

**Micro-CTA:**
Start as a student →

### Column 2 – For universities

**Headline:**
For universities that still care if their students can think.

**Body:**
Archiv can sit alongside your LMS, not replace it.

* Stress-tested training modules for key courses.
* Structured prompts that demand reasoning, not plagiarism.
* Configurable difficulty and repetition, aligned with your syllabus.

Give your students access to AI that builds integrity instead of undermining it.

## SECTION 6 – SOCIAL PROOF (YOU CAN SWAP IN REAL QUOTES)

**Eyebrow:**
What early users are saying.

**Headline:**
“Harder than homework. Better than homework.”

**Testimonial 1:**

> “I used to open an AI, paste the question, and move on. With Archiv, I can’t hide. It keeps asking until I actually understand. I hated it for a week. Now I rely on it.”
> — Rafa, Computer Science student

**Testimonial 2:**

> “The first time I walked into an exam after training with Archiv, it felt weirdly familiar. Same pressure, same kind of questions, but my brain didn’t freeze.”
> — Anders, Engineering student

**Testimonial 3:**

> “My students treat most AI like a vending machine. Archiv feels more like a flight simulator. They come out less impressed and more prepared.”
> — Bryan, Lecturer

## SECTION 7 – PRICING / ACCESS

**Eyebrow:**
Start where it matters most.

**Headline:**
Your brain is the product. Not you.

**Body:**
We don’t sell your data. We don’t sell your attention.

We give you a place to train.

**Tier suggestion (you can adjust numbers later):**

* Basic progress tracking

**Archiv Pro**

**Note line:**

**CTA:**
Start free. Upgrade if it earns it.

## SECTION 8 – PHILOSOPHY / MANIFESTO SLICE

**Eyebrow:**
Why Archiv exists.

**Headline:**
Because outsourcing your brain has a cost.

**Body:**
We’re entering a world where AI can write, solve, summarize, and simulate almost anything.

That’s good for convenience.
It’s terrible for unused potential.

Archiv is a small rebellion against mental autopilot.

It’s for the people who still want to be sharp.
Who still want to trust their own recall.
Who still want to feel their brain doing the work.

You don’t have to use Archiv.
You could let AI think for you.

But if you plan to be the kind of person others rely on
when things are hard and stakes are high —
you’ll want to fall back to training.
